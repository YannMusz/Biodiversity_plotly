# Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly


## Purpose
1. Create basic plots like bar, line and pie charts with Plotly
2. Using d3.Json to get data from api's and CSV's
3. Manipulation of Data using functional programming in Javascript
4. Parse data(JSON)
6. Use JavaScript's Math library
7. Using interactivity to better display visualizations of data
9. Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Overview
